        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="microsoft-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>Microsoft Website "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            I edited the text on the Microsoft homepage to say "Meet the wannabe computer you cannot talk to!!" I chose to do this
            to make it funny. I chose to modify the background color to bright green. I felt at times I was lost with all the coding,
            and some of the changes I was trying to make did not work. I think I need to work with the inspect element tool more.
            I have a better understanding of dev tools and it will help me learn how to put html and css together and fix errors."

        <h1>My Favorite Places Collection</h1>
        <p>
            This is my collection of photos of places that I have visited since I have been with my fiancée. They are very
            special to me because they are memories that will last forever. I have visited more places with her in the last 
            eleven months than I have in many years prior. 
        </p>

                    This is one of my favorite places that I have visited! The view is amazing and during September, the 
                    weather is great! We stayed at a beautiful resort right on the beach and enjoyed every moment of our time there.
                    The beach was not crowded during this time of the year so we were able to truly relax. The time seemed like it 
                    slowed down. We enjoyed walking along the beach, collecting shells, and watching the sunset every evening. I cant
                    wait to go back and sip on some drinks at the swim-up bar!

                    The Lodge in Cloudcroft, New Mexico was an amazing place to stay. We like the rustic look of the Lodge
                    and enjoyed some wine next to the fireplace at the entrance. We met some really nice people and later on
                    that night we went for a ghost hunt to try and find Rebecca, the ghost that is said to haunt the Lodge.

                    The Oasis in Austin, Texas is a beautiful place located on the cliffs overlooking Lake Travis.
                    My fiancée and I were able to make it at the perfect time to see the sunset. It was a special moment 
                    for both of us.

                    Cloudcroft is one of my favorite mountain towns to visit. Its about an hour and a half drive from El Paso. 
                    It is a place that my fiancée and I like to go to get some fresh air with about a twenty degree drop in 
                    temperature compared to El Paso. We enjoy walking around the village and exploring the shops. We hike on 
                    trails that are right down the road from the village. We always come across wildlife on our hikes such as 
                    the mule deer.

                <p class="description">
                    Lady Bird Lake was an amazing place to visit. We rented kayaks and went around the lake for a couple of hours.
                    The views of the city from the lake are amazing! I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin, Texas.
                    Make sure to paddle in the right direction against the current when you start and with the current when you 
                    return the kayaks. We made that mistake and it was tiring!

                <p class="description">
                    My fiancée and I love BBQ and we heard about Salt Lick BBQ in Driftwood, Texas from one of her coworkers. Some
                    of the best BBQ I have had! I recommend stopping by Fredricksburg and doing some wine tasting on your way to 
                    Salt Lick.

        <h1>My Top 5 Favorite Destinations</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Puerto Penasco</h2>
                <p>
                    Also known as Rocky Point, this beach town in Mexico is one of my
                    favorite places to go with my fiancee!
                </p>

                <h2>Dubai</h2>
                <p>
                    Dubai was one of my favorite places when I traveled the world in the 
                    Navy. The skyline was amazing and the resorts were well maintained.
                    I enjoyed the infinity pool overlooking the city.

                <h2>Rio De Jinero</h2>
                <p>
                    Rio De Jinero was amazing to visit. The aircraft carrier I was on pulled
                    into port and while we were coming into port the view of Christ the Redeemer
                    was something I will never forget!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Cloudcroft</h2>
                <p>
                    My fiancee and I love to go to Cloudcroft for a weekend getaway. The temperature
                    is alot cooler than El Paso and it's a nice change of scenery with all the trees.
                    I highly recommend staying at the Lodge and searching for the ghost!

                <h2>Truth or Consequences</h2>
                <p>
                    My fiancee and I love going to T or C to relax in the hot springs. There are multiple
                    hot springs to choose from, but we like to stay at the Blackstone Hotsprings Resort.
                    We have stayed there twice and it is very relaxing! I recommend going during the cooler
                    months.
